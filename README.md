## How to Use

### 1. Create a Symposium

- The description becomes part of the global context sent to all consultants

### 2. Add Consultants
- Click "Add Consultant"
- Choose an LLM model from the OpenRouter catalog (with pricing info)
- Write a system prompt defining the consultant's expertise and role
- Each consultant can use a different model optimized for their specialty

### 3. Start Chatting
- Select a consultant from the sidebar
- Type your message and press Enter or click Send
- The consultant receives context including:
  - Symposium description
  - Visible conversation history
  - Their specific role/expertise prompt
  - Your current message

### 4. Manage Context
